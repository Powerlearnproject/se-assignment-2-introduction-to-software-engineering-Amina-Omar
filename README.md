# Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) consists of several phases, including:
Requirements: Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
Design: Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
Implementation: Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
Deployment: Releasing the software to users or customers.
Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.

# Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

 Waterfall: Sequential approach with distinct phases (e.g., requirements, design, implementation) flowing downwards like a waterfall.
Agile: Iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration, and responding to change.
Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?

Development Approach:

Agile: Iterative and incremental, allowing for ongoing revisions and refinements.
Waterfall: Linear and sequential, requiring each phase to be completed before the next begins.

Flexibility:

Agile: Highly adaptable to changes, even late in the process.
Waterfall: Inflexible to changes once requirements are finalized.

Customer Involvement:

Agile: High level of customer involvement with continuous feedback and collaboration.
Waterfall: Limited customer involvement after the requirements phase.
Documentation:

Agile: Focuses on working software over comprehensive documentation.
Waterfall: Emphasizes thorough documentation at each phase.

Risk Management:

Agile: Risks are managed continuously with regular testing and feedback.
Waterfall: Risks are identified and mitigated primarily during the initial phases.

Delivery:

Agile: Delivers functional software increments regularly throughout the project.
Waterfall: Delivers the final product at the end of the development cycle

Agile is preferred for projects where requirements are expected to change frequently, and there is a need for rapid delivery and continuous improvement. It is ideal for dynamic environments and projects that benefit from regular customer feedback and collaboration.

Waterfall is preferred for projects with well-defined, stable requirements and where thorough documentation and a structured approach are necessary. It is suitable for projects where changes are minimal and predictable, and regulatory compliance or extensive documentation is required.


# Requirements Engineering:
